Is is simple web app tailored for mobile device to keep the track of time
worked on the projects.

- It keeps all data locally on browser, never uploading it to the Internet
- once downloaded, Internet connection is not required (but refresh button
  can be used to download newer version, if user clicks it)
- There is export/import to `.JSON` functionality for backup and restore

- docs - it keeps data locally only
	- optional sync? https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync
- add option for export/import data
- option to refresh, but run offline-first
- better icons
- htaccess caching permanent for icons and version resorces etc.
- HTML/CSS/JS validate
- use HTML time/date pickers? add icon button for "set to current time"
- accesibility check
- README.md live instance link, and mention on https://mnalis.com/
- test in Chromium Lighthouse
  - TypeError: Failed to execute 'fetch' on 'WorkerGlobalScope': 'only-if-cached' can be set only with 'same-origin' mode at https://hours.mnalis.com/sw.js:56:11
	Chromium bug, has workaround - see https://stackoverflow.com/a/49719964/2600099
  - Does not provide a valid apple-touch-icon - https://web.dev/apple-touch-icon/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools
  - HTTP/2 enable ?
  - add robots.txt ?
  - Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: https://hours.mnalis.com/hours-512.png (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)  ??
- offer install: https://web.dev/customize-install/
- split to multiple .js files (+main, +db, +months, -tasks) for readability (and precache all of them!). need copyright in all of them :( also 'part of Hours (c)....' and above explanation of that module
- special button to install App, not automatically on page load
- automatically upgrade / erase cache on app update (refresh)
	maybe "cache, then network/save_to_cache strategy" ?

- on month change, and on page load, update (and) default_month

- +add / -rename / -delete months
+ select current month

- in current month:
  - display current month (just to be sure "select onupdate" is working OK)
  - add event
	- set start time = now, end time= now
	- jump to edit event

  - edit event (with update, cancel and delete inside)
	- update start time
	- update end time
	- update breaks
	- update in which month it is
	- UPDATE / CANCEL / DELETE buttons (disable CANCEL if new event)

- show totals for current month (with and w/o breaks)
- grep FIXME in code
- function prefix for all functions triggered from events (and/or add "evt" parameter)
- clean (and/or setup to current date/time) data when entering new task
- add break as last parameter, so we can use "enter" to submit form (and it is less important)

+ select current month

- in current month:
  - display current month (just to be sure "select onupdate" is working OK)
  - add event
	- set start time = now, end time= now
	- jump to edit event

  - edit event (with update, cancel and delete inside)
	- update start time
	- update end time
	- update breaks
	- update in which month it is
	- UPDATE / CANCEL / DELETE buttons (disable CANCEL if new event)

- show totals for current month (with and w/o breaks)

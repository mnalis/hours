- docs - it keeps data locally only
	- optional sync? https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync
- add option for export/import data
+ option to refresh, but run offline-first
- better icons images
-? htaccess caching permanent for icons and version resorces etc.
- HTML/CSS/JS validate
- use HTML time/date pickers? add icon button for "set to current time"
- accesibility check
- README.md live instance link, and mention on https://mnalis.com/
- test in Chromium Lighthouse
  - TypeError: Failed to execute 'fetch' on 'WorkerGlobalScope': 'only-if-cached' can be set only with 'same-origin' mode at https://hours.mnalis.com/sw.js:56:11
	Chromium bug, has workaround - see https://stackoverflow.com/a/49719964/2600099
  - Does not provide a valid apple-touch-icon - https://web.dev/apple-touch-icon/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools
  - HTTP/2 enable ?
  - add robots.txt ?
  - Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: https://hours.mnalis.com/hours-512.png (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)  ??
- special button to install App, not automatically on page load
	- offer install: https://web.dev/customize-install/
+ split to multiple .js files (+main, +db, +months, +details) for readability (and precache all of them!). need copyright in all of them :( also 'part of Hours (c)....' and above explanation of that module
- automatically upgrade / erase cache on app update (refresh)
	maybe "cache, then network/save_to_cache strategy" ?

+ on month change, and on page load, update (and) default_month

- +add / -rename / -delete months
+ select current month

- in current month:
  + display current month (just to be sure "select onupdate" is working OK)
  + add event
	+? set start time = now, end time= now
	+ jump to edit event

  - edit task (with update, cancel and delete inside)
	- move task from one month to another
	+ update start time (with "set to now()" button)
	+ update end time (with "set to now()" button)
	+ update breaks
	+ UPDATE / CANCEL / DELETE buttons (disable DELETE if new event)

+? show totals for current month (with and w/o breaks)
- default focus on new task button?
- when clicking on "new task"
	- focus on "Start" field
	+? autofill beginning of date with current yyyy-mm
	+ html5 date/time pickers?

- refresh button
	- make it work
	- disabled by default, enable when everything is ready at the end of main.js (how to check if sw.js cacheAll is still running?)
		so we avoid the possible race (cacheAll of fetch/cache.put running when we refresh)
		- also in not yet installed, replace it by default with install button which does SW install (instead of doing SW install on body load!)
	- see how to flush all cache (probably should have fake URL, that sw.js fetch method will intercept and do the cache cleaning and reload) - add console.info too
	- does cacheAll update all content? it would be better than deleteall+cacheall again, as flaky network conn wouldn't ruin the day.
		- perhaps we should load all in different cache, and then switch to it if all went well?
	- hide it in collapsed-by-default div so it isn't clicked by error
	- beware of the update bugs - see https://stackoverflow.com/a/52830680/2600099

- use "button type=submit" instead of "input type=submit" to have them all
  look the same

- load all resources with ?md5=xxxxxxxx; and update "make publish" to update
  to all md5s
- keyboard shortcuts (and add as hover text "title=" on buttons)
- grep FIXME in code
- function prefix for all functions triggered from events (and/or add "evt" parameter)
- clean (and/or setup to current date/time) data when entering new task
- add "break" as last parameter in new task, so we can use "enter" to submit form (and it is less important)
- update README.md
- CSS & HTML styling
- sort task table
- better name than "task" for strings / variables / functions?? ("event"? "hour"? "billed"?)
- remove/comment-out console.debug etc debugging at the end
- last updated string on home (collapsable about?) and utf8 refresh button
	- main.js set_refresh_DB(1)
	   - serviceworker checks _REFRESH, and if non-zero
		- fetch goes direct to network
		- install - cacheAll all resources, and when all caches complete, set _REFRESH=0 again and _LASTUPDATE=`date`
			- will install be called? how to force reload serviceworker? check docs
	- main.js when _REFRESH=0, show notice and force reload page
+ also, check that app does not lose data over serveral days, before using it in production...
- also, check in several different browsers on multiple devices
- what if web page is open in multiple tabs, and edited in non-newest?
  have safety like hidden HTML element with timestamp, and copy in DB, and refuse to add/update/delete if they do not match?
- CSS hover change color of row, to indicate we can edit it... but what to do on mobile?
- on new or edit task, shift focus to details form
- sort task list by date+start_time (newest on top)
- show red message below or above table when item deleted, and/or color row which was edited/created last
